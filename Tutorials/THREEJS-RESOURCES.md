# Three.js + React — Resources & Example Projects

A curated list of sites, demos, and open-source projects to help you imagine what is possible. Start with the **Learning path** section if you are new.

---

## Learning Path (recommended order)

1. **Three.js fundamentals** — Understand scenes, cameras, meshes, lights (you already have this in your app).
2. **Browse official examples** — Skim what exists; pick 2–3 that excite you.
3. **Try React Three Fiber (R3F)** — Same Three.js engine, but components fit naturally into React.
4. **Study one full project** — Clone a repo, run it locally, change one thing at a time.
5. **Build a small idea** — One scene, one interaction (slider controls a color, scroll moves the camera, etc.).

## Ideas: What Could *You* Build?

Use this table to connect **ideas** to **techniques** you would need to learn.

| Project idea | Three.js / React skills involved |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Interactive product viewer** (rotate a shoe, change color) | GLTF loader, OrbitControls, material color from React state |
| **Music visualizer** | Audio analyser, buffer geometry, shaders, `useFrame` loop |
| **Generative art / daily sketch** | Noise functions, instancing, random seeds, export as image |
| **Mini game** (collect items, simple physics) | Raycasting (click), collision, Rapier physics + R3F |
| **Data visualization in 3D** | Bar charts as boxes, scale from JSON, labels with Drei `<Text>` |
| **Architectural walkthrough** | GLTF scene, camera paths, scroll or click navigation |
| **Particle field controlled by sliders** | Points material, your side panel → React state → uniforms |
| **Portfolio with one hero scene** | One polished scene + minimal UI (like your current layout) |
| **Shader playground** | Custom GLSL, tweak params with sliders in your side panel |
| **Timeline / keyframe animator** | GSAP or custom; store keyframes in React state |

---

## Techniques Map (when you see something cool)

| You see… | Look up… |
|----------|----------|
| Realistic lighting | PBR materials, environment maps (HDRI), `MeshStandardMaterial` |
| Glow / bloom | Post-processing (`@react-three/postprocessing`) |
| Smooth scroll + 3D | GSAP ScrollTrigger, R3F ScrollControls |
| Custom look (water, glitch) | Fragment shaders (GLSL) |
| 3D text | Drei `<Text>`, `<Text3D>`, or font loaders |
| Import Blender models | Export as `.glb`, use `useGLTF` from Drei |
| Many trees / rocks | InstancedMesh, or Drei `<Instances>` |
| Click to select objects | Raycaster, pointer events in R3F |
| Performance issues | Lower polygon count, instancing, lazy load, `dpr` cap |

---

## Libraries to Know (React ecosystem)

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@react-three/fiber` | React renderer for Three.js |
| `@react-three/drei` | Helpers (controls, loaders, HTML overlay, etc.) |
| `@react-three/postprocessing` | Bloom, depth of field, vignette |
| `@react-three/rapier` | Physics engine |
| `leva` | Debug panel with sliders (great for prototyping) |
| `gsap` | Timeline animation (UI + camera) |
| `zustand` | Simple global state (share values between UI and 3D) |

---

## Suggested First Study Session (~2 hours)

1. Open https://threejs.org/examples/ — click **5 random examples**, read each source file for 5 minutes.
2. Open https://bruno-simon.com/ — ask: what is 3D vs 2D UI overlay?
3. Fork one CodeSandbox R3F demo — change mesh color and camera position.
4. In **your** app: connect one side-panel slider to cube rotation (small step toward interactivity).
